Effect size measure,Strengths,Weaknesses
Within-case Standardized Mean (dBR),"Historically, most common method in aphasia & related disorders","Influenced by experimental design features (e.g.,  item set-size, baseline/treatment length)"
,Easy to implement,No clear solution to cases of low baseline variability
,,Interpretation depends on benchmark study
,,Lacks a measure of uncertainty
Proportion of Potential Maximal Gain (PMG),Accommodates different item set sizes when comparing across individuals,Confounded by disorder severity if baseline performance is associated with disorder severity
,Easy to implement,Can obscure differences in absolute change scores
,,Lacks a measure of uncertainty
Tau-U,Non-parametric and distribution free,Does not fully characterize the magnitude of change
,Option to adjust for baseline trends,Influenced by ratio of baseline/treatment observations
,Easy to implement,"Lack of easily interpretable scaling; not bounded between [-1, 1]"
,,Tau-UA VS. B – TREND-A lacks a measure of uncertainty
Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) ,Able to adjust for baseline trends,Complex to implement
,"Effect size available in multiple units of measure (e.g., logits, odds-ratio, percent, items gained) each with clear interpretation",Model convergence challenges are common with frequentist estimation
,Pools item-level and/or participant-level data to produce more generalizable estimates,Confidence/Credible interval width dependent on sample size
,Includes confidence/credible interval ,
,Can estimate group and individual effect sizes from a single model (Bayesian),
